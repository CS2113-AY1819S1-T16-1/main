== PROJECT: Trajectory

---

== Overview

Trajectory is a lightweight management system for those who need a no-frills solution for managing students, modules, grades, classes and notes. It is built for users who prefer typing (CLI) over GUI interaction and has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions
* *Code contributed*: https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=jomcruz93[Link to Project Code Dashboard]
* *Main feature implemented*: Notes Management
** What it does: It allows the user to manage notes within the application.
** Justification: This feature improves the product's utility as users would sometimes need to take notes about important things. It serves to make Trajectory a step closer to becoming a one-stop app for users so that they would not need to rely on several other applications to accomplish their needs.
** Highlights: Notes saved in Trajectory can be of two types: a plain sticky note or a calendar event. Those of the latter type are exportable to CSV, which may then be imported to Google Calendar.
