== Introduction

Trajectory is a lightweight management system for those who need a no-frills solution for managing students, modules and classes. It is built for users who prefer typing (CLI) over GUI interaction. Tempted to make the jump? Head on over to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the program link:{repoURL}/releases[here]. [red]*(NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME)*
.  Copy the `.jar` file to your desired location.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `c/MODULE_CODE [p/PREREQUISITES]` can be used as `c/CS2113 p/CS2040C` or as `c/CS2113`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[p/PREREQUISITES]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `p/CS2040C`, `p/CS2040C p/CS1010` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL n/NAME` is also acceptable.
